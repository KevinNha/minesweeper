# MINESWEEPER

## About
I wanted to build a functional minesweeper to focus on writing out the game logic. 

## Requirements
This is built using flask for routing so you need to install flask by running `pip install flask` on your CMD

## How to run
Open app.py and run the file and it'll take you to a localhost server

## To do in the future
* Create a better UI/UX -- At the moment, it's created just for functionality
* Make design scalable to mobile devices
